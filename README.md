Dynamic and Updatable: The most significant advantage. Prices, availability (e.g., "sold out" items), daily specials, and seasonal offerings can be changed in real-time without the need for reprinting
Enhanced Visuals: Can incorporate high-resolution photos, appealing videos, and animated graphics of dishes, making the food look more appetizing and enticing.
Accessibility: Can often include features like larger text options, different language selections, or even audio descriptions, improving accessibility for a wider range of customers.
Cost-Effective in the Long Run: While there's an initial setup cost, it eliminates recurring printing costs associated with traditional menus, especially for establishments with frequent menu changes.
